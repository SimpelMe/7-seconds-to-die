# 7 seconds to die
With this tool you can transfer text from one device to another.

On device 1 you put with "paste" your clipboard into a pastebin. With "copy" on device 2 you fill that clipboard with this bin. But hurry up! 7 seconds after pasting the bin will be killed.

First time you start the tool you will be asked for a name and password. Both must be the same on the second device. If you forgot them or want another name press "reset login" and respawn.

The password is used to encrypt the pastebin. Even for seven seconds it's worth it.

There are two shortcuts to access the tool:
* 1: Paste
* 2: Copy
